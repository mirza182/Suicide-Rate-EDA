# Suicide Rates EDA: A Global Perspective

## Introduction
Close to 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, which translates to one person every 40 seconds. Suicide is a global phenomenon that affects individuals across the lifespan. Effective interventions can be implemented at various levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts. For every adult who dies by suicide, there may be more than 20 others attempting suicide.

## Objective
The objective of this case study is to explore suicide rates globally, identify patterns among different cohorts, and understand the impact of socioeconomic factors. We will use exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to gain insights from the data.

## Data Overview
We will be using a dataset containing suicide rates from 1985 to 2016. The dataset includes the following attributes:

Country: The country where the suicides occurred.\
Year: The year of the recorded suicides.\
Sex: Gender (male or female).\
Age: Suicide age range (divided into six categories).\ 
Suicides_no: The number of suicides.\
Population: Population of that sex, in that age range, in that country, and in that year.\
Suicides/100k pop: Number of suicides per 100,000 population.\
GDP_for_year($): GDP of the country in that year (in dollars).\
GDP_per_capita($): Ratio of the country’s GDP and its population.\
Generation: Generation of the suicides (possible six different categories).\
## Questions to Explore

Age Categories: Is the suicide rate more prominent in some age categories than others?\
Country Analysis: Which countries have the most and least number of suicides?\
Population Impact: What is the effect of population size on suicide rates?\
GDP Influence: How does a country’s GDP impact suicide rates?\
Trend Over Years: What is the trend of suicide rates across all the years?\
Gender Differences: Is there a difference between the suicide rates of men and women?\

## Conclusion
By analyzing this dataset, we aim to contribute to suicide prevention efforts and raise awareness about this critical global issue.\
Feel free to explore the code and visualizations in the notebooks. Let’s work together to understand and address suicide rates worldwide.
